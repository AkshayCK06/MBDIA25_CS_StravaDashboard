# Project: Strava
- How should you build a Data Dashboard on Strava Data?

### Strava is the most popular Web-site of cyclists and runners activities. However, you could we improve on this?
- Learn from projects at hAps://github.com how to retrieve data.
- Discuss the Strava API and alternaKves
- Develop a simple Jupyter notebook that plots acKviKes versus data.
- What tool should you use to implement a Data Dashboard (see example at hAps://github.com). Consider Plotly&Dash or Streamlit? Experiment and discuss.

### Select one tool and start to implement a dashboard:
- Select a acKvity by some criteria, display data as table, graphs,…
- Allow xy - diagrams of data
- Show staKsKcs and data of users list of acKviKes.

Discuss the analysis and design phase of your project.
