That's fine, I'm just thinking of...

So we will explain some what the code, but all the details, but for example, what is this processor or something like that?

Yes, yeah, I would do that.

Well, constant.

So there are some points which I do not immediately understand.

Okay?

So and that's...

That's important for you.

You should somehow explain the code, but you can't go into the details of it authorisation.

You're imagine we can't do that, but you would like to focus on these visualisations and plotting most of that.

I'm not quite sure, but...

Where should I focus on my early favourite question?

Which of focus line on fetching an API calling towards that aspect or then plotting these numbers for visualisations on that aspect?

Yes.

I think this plotting is not as.

As interesting, because I think this is actually that's simple.

Yeah, like they say, everybody knows there's a pie chart also and can do it.

So you can show it as just an example.

Okay.

An interesting point would be when you could develop something which even makes this easier.

So that, for example, a user can, but this is might be too complicated.

So initial plan was using streamlet, we could push this to a web browser-based web-based flashboard.

Yes, that's you could provide.

Yes, exactly.

You could do a dash pot, which you can use for a browser or something like this.

Yes, this would be one option, but all right.

No, my idea is what I personally think it would be nice to have a tool which is flexible.

You see, where you can define what data should you use and what type of diagram will be plotted.

Okay?

When you mean by what data as in, you define a period of data?

Yeah, for example.

So last one week data.

Yeah, just different.

This is usually done with providing a dashpot where you have to boxes, et cetera.

Okay?

Okay.

So that's the web is dashboard where like options are clickable.

So I said, one week, and then a week, and then show, show a car, a show, what kind of data to show?

Like kilometres or height or time, okay?

Yes, that is usually...

And what I think, it's just an idea, I'm just thinking.

Yeah.

In a way, it would be nice to have some...

Okay, to have some domain specific language to say what to show.

Okay?

Okay.

Nowadays, you might do this with ChatGPT or somewhat like this.

Okay.

Um, But I think...

I think 3 options nowadays, how to implement something like this.

You can build a dashboard with a lot of clicks and entry fields and things like this.

Okay?

Second method would be to use ChatGPT, and I don't know, maybe give access to your data, analyse it or something like this.

And the third, uh, why is to to define or to create a language, uh, domain specific language, where you just can, for example, say, uh, scatter, range, and a data type.

Okay, okay.

Okay.

And then you can interactively create a graph, for example.

So, this is not, this is not, it's not possible to program somewhat like this for, uh, yes, non drama or something.

But he could do this when he has a simple language.

And for you, possibly, do you have any idea how to implement this?

I think it's, it's, I took help from the notes because this is plotly again and also ChatGPT help me in some of the codes here.

Yes.

So.

So, this is everything a fine?

But do you want it more customisable according to the user?

So these are just fixed values.

Like I have defined this, okay, show me this graph of activities, but you wanted more customised and the user can choose what to show.

Yes.

So I told you there are any ways...

Three ways.

General three ways for this, okay?

So how can you give an example for this, to make it as a...

Okay, let's say we have something built into Strava, but okay, that's not the way you would like to have the data displayed.

Yeah, okay.

So how can you provide a tool?

Which is flexible?

And you can just show one example or somewhat like this.

I think...

One way to do it to make it simple is when you have over there, and you provide this as a function, okay?

And the user has just to type, show, and then some argument.

This will be the very simple example.

Okay.

But do you want this in a web browser based form?

No, no, no, no, no.

That's too complicated.

Oh, okay, so I know just convert this to a function.

I can call it the back and call it here.

Yes, for example.

Think of what are the important arguments.

You can leave a lot of defaults, okay?

Everything, you know, in Python could easily implement it with default.

Yeah.

And then you can just show in the next notebook instead of this, you will show, uh, can demo this nicely, uh, show data from, or day range or something like this.

And, uh, you see your result.

Okay.

Do you see?

Yeah.

This would be really an advantage for a user.

So, you have shown over here that it works?

The authorisation, everything works.

And now you can program an example, yes, how to use it easily.

Or be able to read it.

Okay.

And this is, in a way, you just have to define some functions.

Okay, okay.

As an example.

But this would be in an IPYND file.

Yeah, okay, cancel.

Okay, so you just For example, over here, uh, Yes, that's all right.

You maybe show those 2 examples, okay?

But then it would be nice to have, okay.

As I told you, in the, let's say in one.. Level, higher level of user interface.

Got it.

And higher levels is ChatGPT.

Oh, the whole language?

Mm-hmm.

And let's say when you define some functions for this, it's a kind of starting point for this.

Okay, got it.

Fine.

Oh, a dishbot.

But do you want to go as to a custom language way?

You may like this, but I think it's easier for you to, yes, that's something to this.

We could also do Call ChatGPT through an API in this and then ask to No, maybe.

Oh, that's idea as well.

Okay, I don't know.

You see, I think we both need to sit and decide on this, which path to take from these three.

Yes, in a way.

The dashboard, the web-based dashboard, then a custom language for these.

What is possible in this time frame?

Et cetera.

Because I think this is somewhat Ah, yes.

But a lot of, you don't want the customer to see all those, all these codes and it make it easier for him.

Okay.

Get it.

I get it.

Okay?

Yeah.

So this would be really a step further than, yes, reduce some data and just show, okay, so you should show one example, but it's...

I get it.

I got it.

But this is not an outright application as such.

Yes.

Yeah.

Like, what you are trying to suggest, that can be converted to a proper application and can be pushed.

Do you get it 1st?

You can not to type or idea for this.

And I told you, I think those are 3 ideas.

What?

Maybe I have another idea, but I think that's it.

Usually they will build another dash pot, I think.

That's the most popular way to do it, I think.

But maybe ChatGPT also, okay?

Nowadays, I don't know.

I never saw it.

But a lot of applications, so something like Strava and now Fitbit and what's the new brand?

Which has a subscription?

Okay, so they have an inbuilt AI chat based agent, which plays with your data, is connected to your data, and you can ask questions.

Okay, now my run is this, what should I do to achieve a better Yes, yes, yes. Or lower heart rate and all of that.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

I had found a page AI.

What was it?

AI...

This was interesting.

But I think that's not...

That's, that's...

Yeah.

They have, but that's...

That's very much more, okay?

That gives you advice. Et cetera, et cetera.

No, no, no, I just want a nice way to analyse on yourself some data.

And I think for this, Strava, it's not very good.

They have their standard ways to display data and set, et cetera, but, for example, they are more interested in, let's say, social rights, and it'll show maps and segments, or I think you know other things.

But it's not, this tool is not Strava, it's not very good in analyse.

In some data, so...

Analysing the first step is usually just show you a nice process, like this, so that you see your efforts, et cetera, what you have already started.

But what I'm missing, actually, it's, it should be flexible.

Yeah.

They don't know what you want to see.

Exactly.

Okay.

I get a point.

I get a point.

And.. Maybe you have another idea how to do this.

You can't implement it.

Mm hmm.

It's a bigger project, actually, to do something like this.

But you can have an idea and have a starting point or one small example for this.

Okay.

This would be nice.

Instead of all his code, it's enough to show some one example.

Yeah, this is just for the classroom, yeah.

Yeah, okay.

Okay.

I think about this professor with my teammate and we'll go through a few options.

The 3 of you, which I'm listening.

Make it too complicated.

Okay.

We'll try.

No, yeah. Okay.

So, uh, okay, and you have to remember, uh, possibly it's too much for those 25 minutes already.

Oh, yeah.

So you have to decide what to show.

But it should give an overall, then everybody recognised that, ah, yes, they had a lot of work, okay?

I know this, it's a lot of work. Still.

But as a final result, organisations.

I go through this.

We've been from a few ideas and maybe we can email you one of those versions in maybe early jam or late December.

I'm sure you would be busy with the Christmas and my arts, but if you could have a look.

I trust you as well.

When you like me, you can, yeah, I can die.

Okay.

But I think you got the idea.

Okay, cool.

But it's your job.

I got it.

Thank you.

Okay.
